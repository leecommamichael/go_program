# This really is how almost all projects look.
Your hard drive has 2 things in it:
        - folders (developers call them directories or dirs or dir)
        - files

Projects have:
        - an entry-point
        - src directory
        - test directory

This project is a folder with an entry-point file called main.go

# Just because you can write an entire triple-A game in your main.go doesn't mean you should.
Almost every language expects a file called `main` to exist, this language does as well.

This language is called Go, it is the Toyota Camry of programming languages.
It will not park itself, it will not drive itself, but it's strong fundamentals make it immortal.

# src means "source" or "source-code", it's the code that runs when the user clicks the executable
# test is a directory of assertions about your source code. You can create tests to verify a program's correctness.

I've written some correct programs in the src directory, but some of my tests make bad assertions.
I need you to make those tests pass.
